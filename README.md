# stm32f7-bootloader

## Audio bootloader for the ???

nb: the below is not directly applicable. needs to be updated for this new project.

//

The core of this bootloader is from the stm-audio-bootloader from [pichenettes](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack). The bootloader.cc file has been modified, and interface/driver files have been added for use with the hardware UI of the Spectral Multiband Resonator (SMR).

The SMR project is located [here](https://github.com/4ms/SMR)

This bootloader works with SMR code that's less than 480kB in size. The reason for this limit is because the audio file is flashed into the upper sectors first (kStartReceiveAddress), and then copied over to the execution sectors (kStartExecutionAddress) only once all data has been received.

## Setting up your environment

Set up the environment exactly as you would in the [SMR project](https://github.com/4ms/SMR)

## Compiling

To compile, simply run:
	
	make

This creates bootloader.bin and bootloader.elf files in the build/ directory

---

To flash the bin file to your SMR hardware using an st-link programmer:

	make flash
	
This will program the first sector with the bootloader (0x08000000).
Note that in the stock SMR, the second sector (0x08004000) is used for system settings, so the bootloader must fit into the first 16kB sector or else the SMR code will need to be altered to prevent over-writing the bootloader.

---

To combine the bootloader with the SMR application code into one bin file:

	make combo

This requires ../SMR/build/main.bin to be already present. A new file combo.bin will be created.

---

To flash combo.bin using an st-link programmer:

	make combo_flash
